<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Vanja Lang. <br/> I am a 25 year old girl living in Sweden. <br/> I work as an IT-consultant in Software Development.</p>

<p>I live in a collective with my boyfriend and two other guys. On my sparetime I like to workout and hang out with my friends. 
  I like to do arts and crafts, usually with my friends. <br/> Right now I am working towards a goal in running, because I signed myself up to a half marathon in June 2025.
</p>

<p>I also like to travel, discover new things and to cook and eat food. Recently I traveled to Portugal and Italy with my boyfriend and friends! 
  I am planning a trip to Berlin this spring, to meet up with friends I made studying abroad. <br/> My favorite place I have been to is Vietnam, Hanoi. 
  It was a magic trip I made with a close girlfriend where we rode a motorbike through the mountains north of Hanoi, ordered and designed our own clothes and met some really nice Canadian travelers.
That trip really made its mark on me, I will always remember it. And I have this strong longing of going back to Vietnam to discover more of the country! </p>
